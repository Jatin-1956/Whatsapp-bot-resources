I feel all the better now that you asked me.
Everything is fine with you around.
Right now, I’m on my way to paving a path to your heart.
I’m single and ready to mingle! (This line never gets old.)
Thank god you finally noticed me! *wink wink*
I have never been so strong. But if I were to collapse right now, it would be straight into your arms.
How is your favorite person doing today?! (Hahaha. This one’s kind of narcissistic.)
Ugh, I have a chronic mental problem. I can’t stop thinking about you!
I’ve been thinking about you all day.
I could really go for a big, warm hug right now. (This is more effective if you act sad and lonely while you say it.)
How am I?! in bed? (Wait, what?!)
The best thing that has happened to me today so far is you asking me about my day.
Not as tired as you running in my thoughts all day long.
Come find out. (Oooh, this sounds like an invitation for something.)
Thank you for asking. You just made my day.
I hope you haven’t forgotten that I exist because I definitely haven’t forgotten about you.
Kiss me, and I’ll instantly feel better.
Well, you already know how I feel about you. So what are you going to do about it?
Let make it short and simple; I love you! (Nothing beats this line when you’re trying to catch someone off guard!)
*Just Stare and Wink* (This may appear awkward, but most people will understand what you’re trying to say.)
Pretty busy. As a matter of fact, I have a meeting with you later in some quiet place. (If you know what I mean.)
How am I?! Is that a pick-up line?
So-so, but talking to you makes me feel so good.
